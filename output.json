    "summary": "•   **Purpose of the Act:** To alter and set the rates for the standard allowance, the limited capability for work (LCW) element, and the limited capability for work and work-related activity (LCWRA) element of Universal Credit, as well as certain rates of income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA IR), for specific tax years from 2026-27 to 2029-30.\n\n•   **Key Definitions:** The Act defines \"standard allowance\" as the basic Universal Credit allowance; \"LCWRA element\" and \"LCW element\" refer to additional amounts for claimants with limited capability for work; \"pre-2026 claimant\" means a claimant continuously entitled to the LCWRA element since before 6 April 2026; \"severe conditions criteria claimant\" is a claimant with limited capability for work and work-related activity where a specific, lifelong bodily or mental condition (as per Schedule 7 descriptors, diagnosed by a healthcare professional) constantly applies.\n\n•   **Eligibility Criteria:** The Act introduces new categories for the LCWRA element, differentiating claimants into \"pre-2026 claimants,\" \"severe conditions criteria claimants,\" \"terminally ill claimants,\" and \"any other claimant,\" with different rates applying to these groups. Eligibility for these specific rates depends on continuous entitlement to the LCWRA element before 6 April 2026 or meeting severe, lifelong disability criteria.\n\n•   **Obligations:** The Secretary of State (and the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland) must exercise relevant powers to ensure that the standard allowance, protected LCWRA amount, and certain ESA IR payments are increased annually by at least the relevant Consumer Prices Index (CPI) percentage, plus a specified uplift percentage for the standard allowance, for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30. The Act also explicitly suspends the general annual up-rating provisions of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 for these specific benefits and elements during these tax years.\n\n•   **Enforcement Elements and Penalties:** The Act does not contain specific enforcement mechanisms or penalties for non-compliance. Its provisions primarily impose statutory duties on the Secretary of State and the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland to set and maintain benefit rates according to the prescribed calculations. Failure to comply would typically be addressed through administrative or judicial review processes rather than specific penalties outlined within this Act.",
    "sections": {
        "definitions": "The Act defines \"consumer prices index\" as the all items index published by the Statistics Board. A \"relevant power\" refers to specific statutory powers used to adjust benefit amounts under the Welfare Reform Act 2012 or Social Security Administration Act 1992 (and corresponding NI legislation). \"The standard allowance\" is the universal credit allowance under the Welfare Reform Act 2012, applicable for assessment periods within a tax year, which is defined as the 12 months beginning 6 April. Key claimant categories like \"pre-2026 claimant\" and \"severe conditions criteria claimant\" are also defined with specific criteria related to their entitlement history and medical conditions.",
        "obligations": "The Secretary of State is obligated to ensure that the standard allowance amounts for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30 meet or exceed minimum calculated levels by exercising relevant statutory powers. Furthermore, the Secretary of State must increase the protected LCWRA amount, standard allowance, and certain legacy Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) components if necessary to maintain their real value against the relevant CPI percentage for the specified tax years. Corresponding obligations apply to the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland for their respective provisions.",
        "responsibilities": "The Secretary of State is responsible for administering the Universal Credit system by ensuring that standard allowance rates and specific elements, such as the protected LCWRA amount, are adjusted annually according to defined calculation methods. This includes applying CPI increases and specific uplift percentages for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30, and exercising statutory powers to implement these changes. The Department for Communities in Northern Ireland holds parallel responsibilities for the corresponding provisions applicable within Northern Ireland.",
        "eligibility": "Eligibility for the LCWRA element of Universal Credit is determined by whether a claimant has limited capability for work and work-related activity, categorizing them as a \"pre-2026 claimant,\" a \"severe conditions criteria claimant,\" terminally ill, or another claimant type. A \"pre-2026 claimant\" must have been continuously entitled to the LCWRA element before 6 April 2026. A \"severe conditions criteria claimant\" requires an assessment confirming limited capability for work and work-related activity, with a lifelong, diagnosed bodily disease/disablement or mental illness/disablement meeting specific Schedule 7 descriptors.",
        "payments": "Standard allowance minimum amounts for tax years 2026-27 to 2029-30 are calculated by increasing the previous year's amount by the relevant CPI percentage and then by a specific uplift percentage (ranging from 2.3% to 4.8%). The LCWRA element for new claimants (not pre-2026, severe conditions criteria, or terminally ill) is set at £217.26, with existing or higher amounts for other categories. The sum of the protected LCWRA amount and standard allowance, as well as certain legacy ESA components, must be increased annually by the relevant CPI percentage to maintain their value.",
        "penalties": "The provided legislative text does not contain any explicit provisions regarding enforcement mechanisms or penalties for non-compliance with the Act's requirements. The Act primarily outlines the obligations of the Secretary of State and the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland concerning benefit calculations and adjustments.",
        "record_keeping": "The Act details processes for assessments and determinations of a claimant's capability for work and severe conditions criteria, including conditions for further assessments based on \"relevant evidence\" such as material facts or changes in physical/mental condition. While these provisions imply the need to maintain records related to claimant assessments and determinations, the text does not explicitly outline specific record-keeping or reporting requirements for administering authorities."

These are explicit eligibility criteria for this claimant category.\n\n2.  **Schedule 1, Paragraph 6 (inserting Regulation 40A into the Universal Credit Regulations 2013)**: Defines 'severe conditions criteria claimant' as: 'A claimant is a “severe conditions criteria claimant” on the basis of an assessment under this Part if— (a) the claimant has limited capability for work and work-related activity on the basis of an assessment under this Part (see regulation 40(2)), and (b) at least one of the descriptors set out in Schedule 7 constantly applies to the claimant and will do so for the rest of the claimant’s life.' These are also explicit eligibility criteria for this claimant category.",

            "evidence": "The Universal Credit Act 2025, as provided, focuses entirely on defining and adjusting the rates and eligibility criteria for various elements of Universal Credit and legacy benefits (e.g., standard allowance, LCWRA element, ESA payments). It mandates the Secretary of State to exercise powers to secure certain benefit amounts (e.g., Section 1(1), Section 4(1)). The schedules detail amendments to existing regulations concerning claimant categories and assessment processes. However, there is no language within the provided text that describes any enforcement mechanisms, penalties, fines, sanctions, or legal consequences for non-compliance by either claimants or the administering body. The Act does not contain provisions for offenses, fraud, or the recovery of overpayments, which are typically where enforcement and penalties would be found in social security legislation.",

It outlines a three-step process involving taking previous year's amounts, increasing by a 'relevant CPI percentage' (defined in 1(3)), and further increasing by a 'relevant uplift percentage' (provided in a table in 1(4)).\n*   **Section 4(2)** describes how the sum of the protected LCWRA amount and standard allowance is to be increased for certain tax years, using the 'relevant CPI percentage'.\n*   **Section 5(1) and (4)** applies the calculation method from Section 1 to legacy Employment and Support Allowance (ESA IR) personal allowance and provides a calculation for increasing other ESA IR components.\n\n**Entitlement Structure Evidence:**\n*   **Section 2(1)** directly amends the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 to insert a specific amount (£217.26) for a 'claimant with limited capability for work and work-related activity, other than a pre-2026 claimant, a severe conditions criteria claimant or a claimant who is terminally ill'. This defines a specific payment amount and the conditions for entitlement.\n*   **Schedule 1, Paragraph 3(a)** amends regulation 27 to state that the LCWRA element award is determined 'by reference to whether the claimant is— (a) a pre-2026 claimant, (b) a severe conditions criteria claimant, (c) terminally ill, or (d) any other claimant.' This clearly outlines different categories of entitlement.\n*   **Schedule 1, Paragraph 4** defines 'pre-2026 claimant' based on continuous entitlement to the LCWRA element before a specific date.\n*   **Schedule 1, Paragraph 6** defines 'severe conditions criteria claimant' based on an assessment and specific descriptors related to bodily or mental disablement, establishing criteria for this entitlement.",

This amendment to an existing regulation titled 'information requirement' directly indicates the presence of reporting requirements. Furthermore, Schedule 1, Paragraph 6(1) defines a 'severe conditions criteria claimant' based on a 'determination... on the basis of an assessment', and Paragraph 6(3) requires that the claimant's incapability arises from a condition 'that has been diagnosed by an appropriately qualified health care professional'. These processes inherently necessitate the keeping of records of assessments, determinations, and medical diagnoses, and the reporting of information to support these.",
